The AHEAD project is one of the most underrated projects I have been part of. The special circumstance is that we have access to a unique dataset, which is allows us to dive deep into what actually influences electricity consumption and quantify that. In AHEAD I was able to cross socio-economic features of the entire Danish population which include household sizes, age groups, income, vehicles etc. with electricity consumption. Even though the smart meter rollout was happening in 2017, which is the year we got the data for, we were able to maintain useful data for approximately 1.6 million households of around 2.0 million households. 
This job was in particular interesting as it forced me to use several coding methods such as batching and parallelization. Crossing the available smart meter data with the socio-economic parameters contained several terabyte of data. Optimizing functions and routines was therefore undeniably necessary in order to utilize the limitted hardware in a most efficient manner. Papers from this project will follow soon and I expect several more outcomes to be published in the first year in my PhD.
